### What You Will Learn:
- Python Basics
- Conditionals
- Loops

---

### Instructions:

1. **Ask for User Input:**
   - The string **must be exactly 10 characters long**.

2. **Check the Length of the String:**
   - If the string is **less than 10 characters**, print: `"String not long enough."`
   - If the string is **more than 10 characters**, print: `"String too long."`
   - If the string is **exactly 10 characters**, print: `"Perfect string"` and proceed to the next steps.

3. **Print the First and Last Characters:**
   - Once the string is validated, print the **first** and **last** characters.

4. **Build the String Character by Character:**
   - Using a `for` loop, construct and print the string **character by character**. Start with the first character, then the first two characters, and so on, until the entire string is printed.
   
   **Hint:** You can create a loop that goes through the string, adding one character at a time, and print it progressively.

   Example:
   
   ![Alt text](./example-dc-w1d1.png)


5. **Bonus: Jumble the String (Optional)**
   - As a bonus, try **shuffling** the characters in the string and print the newly jumbled string.
   **Hint:** You can use the `random.shuffle` function to shuffle a list of characters.
